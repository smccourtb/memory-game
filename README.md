## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit with this project. This is my 3rd project using React but my 1st with styled components. I like
how closely the two are related and how they share the component/prop aspect. I learned how to pass props into
components, so I can apply properties conditionally> I like this method as it reduces the amount of classes I needed to
create. The "css" is much more succinct and easier to follow. Huge fan.

### Continued development

I couldn't get a clear answer on this searching around, but I feel my implementation of props is messy and could be
simplified. I'd like thoroughly plan through my next project and avoid the pitfalls I ran into this project, such as
dealing with setInterval, setTimeout, and how and where to manage state more efficiently. TESTS TESTS TESTS. My next
focus will be testing. I plan to go back through my projects and incorporate tests using Jest.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - These docs were my bible throughout this project. Great
  resource from the devs themselves.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - This site was a huge help for me. Everything was explained
  clearly with great examples.
